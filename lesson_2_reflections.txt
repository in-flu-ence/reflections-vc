What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This will initiate the git system to track changes and writing metadata when a commit function is called.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers a temporary tracking space for files that are potentially used for commit. This allows separation of files for executing a commit.
