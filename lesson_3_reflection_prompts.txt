When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To push production quality code for team collaboration as well as fetching team modified code to local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid Git automatically overwrite changes currently being worked on in the local directory.
